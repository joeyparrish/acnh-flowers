<p class="prose">
There are three hybrid lilies: black, pink, and orange. Pink is frequently
a side effect of working on black.
</p>

<details>
  <summary><h3>Black Lilies</h3></summary>

  <p class="prose">
  Black lilies are easy: red &times; red = black (25% of the time). You are
  just as likely to get pink while working toward black, so you might as well
  do both at once if you want every color.
  </p>

  {{ 'lily' | hybridize('red', 'red',
     layout='a',
     red='trash',
     pink='keep', black='keep') }}

  <details>
    <summary>Black lily self-breeding</summary>

    <p class="prose">
    These <i>particular</i> black lilies can always breed together to make
    more. This is more space-efficient than cloning layouts. Other genotypes of
    black may produce other results.
    </p>

    {{ 'lily' | hybridize('200', '200',
       layout='a',
       black='keep') }}
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3>Pink Lilies</h3></summary>

  <p class="prose">
  Pink lilies are easy: red &times; white = pink (50% of the time). But if
  you're also working toward black lilies, you can skip this. You will very
  likely get pink lilies while working toward black lilies.
  </p>

  {{ 'lily' | hybridize('red', 'white',
     layout='b',
     white='trash',
     pink='keep') }}

  <details>
    <summary>Pink lily self-breeding</summary>

    <p class="prose">
    Pink lilies bred with each other will make more pink lilies only
    <i>31.25%</i> of the time. Since the red-white breeding produces pink
    <i>50%</i> of the time, it is better either to continue breeding those or
    to rely on cloning layouts to create more pink lilies.
    </p>

    {{ 'lily' | hybridize('101', '101',
       layout='a',
       red='trash', white='trash', black='trash',
       pink='keep') }}
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h3>Orange Lilies</h3></summary>

  <p class="prose">
  Orange lilies are easy: red &times; yellow = orange (50% of the time).
  </p>

  {{ 'lily' | hybridize('red', 'yellow',
     layout='b',
     yellow='trash', orange='keep') }}

  <details>
    <summary>Orange lily self-breeding</summary>

    <p class="prose">
    Orange lilies bred with each other will make more orange lilies only
    <i>43.75%</i> of the time. The red-yellow breeding produces orange
    <i>50%</i> of the time, but recycling orange offspring will accelerate the
    orange self-breeding process. Orange offspring will often have genes that
    further increase the odds of more orange offspring to <i>62.5% - 100%</i>.

       layout='a',
