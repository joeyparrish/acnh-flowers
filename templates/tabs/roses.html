<p>
There are more rose colors than any other flower. There are also more complex
genes for roses than any other flower. Blue roses are the most rare.

  <summary><h3>Blue Roses</h3></summary>

  <p>
  Blue roses are by far the most rare phenotype (1 genotype out of 81), so the
  breeding paths to blue roses are long, numerous, and varied. If you want to
  read an excellent and detailed write-up on blue roses, the various
  recommended methods, and their trade-offs, refer to
  <a href="https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/bluerose.html">Yue's Blue Rose Guide</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  This guide uses the Folklore method, which has a small chance of blue roses
  (6.25%) in the second-to-last stage, plus the highest chance of a blue rose
  in the final stage (25%). This allows you to keep breeding that final plot to
  produce more blue roses instead of relying on cloning to scale up blue rose
  production.
  </p>

  <p>
  This method involves six stages, each in their own zippy for clarity.

    <summary><h4>Stage 1</h4></summary>

    {{ 'rose' | hybridize('white', 'yellow',
       yellow='trash', white='next-stage') }}

    {{ 'rose' | hybridize('white', 'white',
       white='trash', purple='next-stage') }}

    {{ 'rose' | hybridize('red', 'yellow',
       yellow='trash', orange='future-stage') }}
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h4>Stage 2</h4></summary>

    {{ 'rose' | hybridize('0110', '0020',
       white='trash', purple='next-stage') }}
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h4>Stage 3 (Testing)</h4></summary>

    <p>
    Here we need to test our purple roses from stage 2. Half of them are
    <tt>0020</tt>, which won't help, and half of them are <tt>0120</tt>, which
    we want to use in the next stage. We test them through breeding to find out
    which genes they have. This requires a specific testing layout so that you
    always know which output came from which pair.
    </p>

    <p>
    To differentiate, we breed the purples with seed yellows. If we get a
    yellow offspring, the purple was <tt>0120</tt>, and it moves to the next
    stage. If it breeds white more than 4 times, we assume it was <tt>0020</tt>
    and throw the purple away.
    </p>

    {{ 'rose' | test(['0020', '0120'], 'yellow', 5,
       white='trash', yellow='pass-purple') }}

  <details>
    <summary><h4>Stage 4</h4></summary>

    {{ 'rose' | hybridize('0120', '1100',
       white='trash', red='trash', yellow='trash',
       orange='next-stage') }}
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h4>Stage 5</h4></summary>

    {{ 'rose' | hybridize('1210', '1210',
       white='trash', orange='trash', yellow='trash',
       blue='keep', red='next-stage') }}
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h4>Stage 6</h4></summary>

    {{ 'rose' | hybridize('1220', '1220',
       white='trash', red='recycle', blue='keep') }}
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Blue rose self-breeding</summary>

    <p>
    You can always breed blue roses together to make more. This is more
    space-efficient than cloning layouts.
    </p>

    {{ 'rose' | hybridize('2220', '2220', blue='keep') }}
