  <p>
  Each type of flower has three genes (red, yellow, and white). Each individual
  has two copies of each gene, and each copy is either dominant or recessive.
  For example, you might see a plant with two dominant red genes refered to as
  <tt>RR</tt>, or two recessive red genes as <tt>rr</tt>, or one of each as
  <tt>Rr</tt>.
  </p>

  <p>
  In this guide, we use a numerical representation instead. If the plant has
  two dominant copies (<tt>RR</tt> in the examples above), we use the number
  <tt>2</tt>. One dominant copy (<tt>Rr</tt>) is 1. And no dominant copies (two
  recessive copies, or <tt>rr</tt>) is 0.
  </p>

  <p>
  We list these gene sequences in the order of red, yellow, white. So if you 
  see <tt>201</tt>, that plant has two dominant red genes, zero dominant yellow
  genes, and one dominant white gene.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sometimes the phenotypes (the visual expression) of a certain genotype (exact
  gene sequence) may surprise you. For example, two dominant white genes
  (<tt>WW</tt>) tends to make roses purple, while it tends to make some other
  flowers blue. And the various color genes also combine in different ways from
  flower to flower. (For a full table of genotypes to phenotypes, see
  <a href="https://aiterusawato.github.io/satogu/acnh/flowers/genotypes.html">Flower Genotypes Table by Aeter</a>.)
  </p>

  <p>
  Roses are an exception in this system. They have four genes instead of three.
  The fourth gene is sometimes called a "brightness" or "shade" gene. Because
  roses have four genes, there are 81 different genotypes. However, only 1 of
  those produces blue roses. This is why breeding blue roses takes so many
  steps.
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, you should know that when you plant seeds, you get a very specific,
  known gene sequence for those plants. Seed plants are always the starting
  points for the breeding guides so that we can control the genes and know what
  we've planted. We use this seed bag icon to represent these in the breeding
  tables: <img class="seed-example" title="Seed Bag">
