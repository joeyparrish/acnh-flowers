  <p>
  This is an "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" flower breeding guide for nerds
  like me. I had a lot of questions that weren't answered by other guides and
  infographics. I was able to work out a lot of answers from other guides, but
  needed some of those answers compiled into a readable format.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, if you are missing:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>all the gene sequences for all flower species
    <li>all the possible outcomes of a breeding pair, not just the target
    <li>a clear layout for each breeding scenario
    <li>every possible optimization in your flower breeding
  </ul>

  <p>
  ... then this is the guide for you.

  <h3>Usage</h3>

  <p>
  If you don't know how flower genes work, read the
  <a href="#flower-genes-primer">Flower Genes Primer</a> tab, which is based on
  the genes section of Aeter's guide. The 3-digit and 4-digit numbers next to
  flowers in the breeding tables here are gene sequences.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you want to breed all the various hybrid colors of a certain flower, click
  the tab for that flower to see breeding stages and notes.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you aren't familiar with the best layouts for breeding and cloning, you'll
  also want to refer to the <a href="#breeding-layouts">Breeding Layouts</a>
  tab, which is based on Yue's guide with additional notes. Each flower
  breeding table recommends a specific layout and links to this guide.
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, there are appendices with
  <a href="#first-gen-hybrids">All First Generation Hybrids</a>
  and <a href="#all-phenotypes">All Phenotypes and their Genes</a> for all
  flower species in the game.

<h3>Legend</h3>

<p class="prose">
These are the conventions we will follow and icons we will use in the breeding
tables.

<div class="green-table legend">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="thing">{{'mum'|flower_icon('red', '100')}}</td>
      <td class="explanation">Flower icon, with tooltip showing its color</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="thing"><div class="genes">101</div></td>
      <td class="explanation">Numeric gene sequence for this flower</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td class="explanation">Recycle this offspring into this stage; notes will elaborate</td>

    <tr>

      <td class="explanation">Keep this; you did it!</td>
