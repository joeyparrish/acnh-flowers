<p>
There are three hybrid mums: green, pink, and purple. Pink and purple are
frequent side-effects of pursuing green, so the green path is probably the only
one you need to follow if you are trying to breed all colors.

  <summary><h3>Goal: green mums</h3></summary>

  <p>
  Start with red and yellow to get a hybrid yellow, then combine hybrid yellows
  to get purple, pink, and green.  Recycle purples into the hybrid yellows.
  </p>

  {{ 'mum' | hybridize('red', 'yellow',
     yellow='next-stage') }}

  {{ 'mum' | hybridize('110', '110',
     white='trash', yellow='trash', red='trash', purple='recycle',
     pink='keep', green='keep') }}

  <p>
  Recycling purples into the yellows will accelerate the process by increasing
  the likelihood of green hybrids. If you get a purple and your plot is full,
  replace a yellow with a purple.

    <summary>Green mum self-breeding</summary>

    <p>
    You can always breed green mums together to make more.  This is more
    space-efficient than cloning layouts.

  <summary><h3>Goal: pink mums</h3></summary>

  <p>
  Pink mums are easy, but if you're also working toward green mums, you can
  skip this. You will very likely get pink mums while working toward green
  mums.

  {{ 'mum' | hybridize('red', 'white', pink='keep') }}

<details>
  <summary><h3>Goal: purple mums</h3></summary>

  <p>
  Purple mums are easy, but if you're also working toward green mums, you can
  skip this. You will very likely get pink mums while working toward green
  mums.
